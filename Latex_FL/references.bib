abstract = {We design a novel, communication-efficient, failure-robust protocol for secure aggregation of high-dimensional data. Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers $1.73 x communication expansion for 210 users and 220-dimensional vectors, and 1.98 x expansion for 214 users and 224-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.},

ABSTRACT = {Federated learning is a decentralized topology of deep learning, that trains a shared model through data distributed among each client (like mobile phones, wearable devices), in order to ensure data privacy by avoiding raw data exposed in data center (server). After each client computes a new model parameter by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based on their own local data, these locally-computed parameters will be aggregated to generate an updated global model. Many current state-of-the-art studies aggregate different client-computed parameters by averaging them, but none theoretically explains why averaging parameters is a good approach. In this paper, we treat each client computed parameter as a random vector because of the stochastic properties of SGD, and estimate mutual information between two client computed parameters at different training phases using two methods in two learning tasks. The results confirm the correlation between different clients and show an increasing trend of mutual information with training iteration. However, when we further compute the distance between client computed parameters, we find that parameters are getting more correlated while not getting closer. This phenomenon suggests that averaging parameters may not be the optimum way of aggregating trained parameters.},

abstract="Background: Regular physical activity is known to be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, most of the people who have diabetes lead a sedentary lifestyle. Smartphones create new possibilities for helping people to adhere to their physical activity goals through continuous monitoring and communication, coupled with personalized feedback. Objective: The aim of this study was to help type 2 diabetes patients increase the level of their physical activity. Methods: We provided 27 sedentary type 2 diabetes patients with a smartphone-based pedometer and a personal plan for physical activity. Patients were sent short message service messages to encourage physical activity between once a day and once per week. Messages were personalized through a Reinforcement Learning algorithm so as to improve each participant's compliance with the activity regimen. The algorithm was compared with a static policy for sending messages and weekly reminders. Results: Our results show that participants who received messages generated by the learning algorithm increased the amount of activity and pace of walking, whereas the control group patients did not. Patients assigned to the learning algorithm group experienced a superior reduction in blood glucose levels (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) compared with control policies, and longer participation caused greater reductions in blood glucose levels. The learning algorithm improved gradually in predicting which messages would lead participants to exercise. Conclusions: Mobile phone apps coupled with a learning algorithm can improve adherence to exercise in diabetic patients. This algorithm can be used in large populations of diabetic patients to improve health and glycemic control. Our results can be expanded to other areas where computer-led health coaching of humans may have a positive impact.

abstract="The following research is based on a portfolio of non-performing loans (NPLs), which was previously acquired and managed by a collection agency, the company under study is one of the owners of the portfolio. The study compares the efficiency and performance of several machine learning algorithms to develop and implement a forecasting tool to estimate the recovery rate of NPL portfolios. These models help to enhance and support the debt collection operation, allowing to forecast the number of debtors that will be recovered in the lifetime of the portfolio, as well as to efficiently manage resources (recovery task force) by reducing costs and expenses. The application aims to support the valuation process at the time of portfolio purchase. The study shows that the application using a binary ranking approach based on the XGBoost model outperforms other techniques, offering good results. It is also evident that product type was one of the most influential variables among the different models. The model using this algorithm could serve as a decision support tool, precisely in the operation of purchasing a portfolio of unprofitable debts, as it allows the quantification of the client's debt to be recovered by identifying the group of potential debtors with the highest probability of compliance, which would result in a faster and more efficient debt collection process.",
