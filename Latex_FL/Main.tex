\textbf{Why Federated Learning?}


\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Data Privacy} Data from bearing-motor assemblies may contain sensitive or proprietary information. FL enables the training of models directly on the edge devices or local servers where the data is generated, eliminating the need to transfer or centralize the data preserving data confidentially.
    
    \item \textbf{Decentralized Data} different assemblies or locations may exhibit variations due to environmental conditions, load characteristics, or specific operational factors capturing these unique variations and enabling more accurate and robust predictions tailored to individual assembly conditions

    
    \item \textbf{Reduced Data Transfer} time-consuming, resource-intensive, and subject to network limitations as data is trained on local data sources

    
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Adaptability} Federated Learning, models can be trained locally on the edge devices or servers in real-time, allowing them to adapt and update based on the latest data. This enables the models to capture the evolving behavior of the assemblies and maintain accurate predictions

    
    \item \textbf{Scalability and Efficiency} leverages the computational power available at the edge devices or local servers  enables scalability, as more devices can contribute to the training process. It also reduces the burden on the central server
    
    
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Knowledge Sharing} facilitates collaboration between different stakeholders involved in bearing-motor assemblies. Local models can be aggregated to create a global model, which represents the collective knowledge from various sources. promotes knowledge sharing, enabling the identification of common patterns

\textbf{Hypothesis:}

% By using a federated approach, a more accurate and generalizable RUL predictor can be developed. This will lead to an effective and rapid of identifying excessive wear conditions or defective/damaged products before they materialize, resulting in improved efficiency and cost savings for businesses.

\textbf{Definitions: }

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Crest Factor: Ratio of the peak amplitude of a signal to its RMS $Peak_g$ / $RMS_g$
    \item Derived Peak: The highest value of the signal is obtained by calculating the peak values over a given time period.
    \item Peak
    \item RMS: root mean square value of a signal over a given time period. The square root of the mean of the squares of all the instantaneous values of the signal.
    \item True Peak: It is the highest instantaneous peak value of a signal, including any inter-sample peaks that may occur when the signal is converted from a digital to an analog format.
    \item High Frequency: It is the root mean square value of the high-frequency content of a signal, typically above 10 kHz.
    \item Kurtosis It is a statistical measure that describes the shape of a distribution, specifically how peaked or flat it is. It is calculated as the fourth standardized moment of a distribution, relative to the square of the second moment (variance).

\end{enumerate}
 The problem is a supervised learning problem, specifically a regression or classification task, depending on the desired output representation.

Input Data: The input data consists of relevant features or measurements from the motor-bearing setup. These features can include sensor readings such as vibration data, temperature, electrical current, or any other relevant signals that can capture the behavior of the system.

Output: The output of the machine learning model is the prediction or estimation of the offset between the motor and bearing. This can be represented as a continuous value (regression) indicating the magnitude of the offset or as discrete classes (classification) representing different levels of offset (e.g., low, medium, high).

Training Data: The training dataset consists of paired examples where each input sample is associated with the corresponding ground truth offset value. These examples are typically generated by measuring the system under different known offset conditions or by manually inducing offsets during data collection.

Model Development: The machine learning model is trained using the labeled training data to learn the relationship between the input features and the offset. Various algorithms can be employed, such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, or more advanced techniques like deep neural networks.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate set of labeled data called the validation or test dataset. Performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) for regression or accuracy, precision, and recall for classification can be used to assess the model's performance and compare different models.

Deployment and Prediction: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model takes the input features from the motor-bearing setup and outputs an estimated offset value or class, pro
